# Welcome to Jean's Online Professional Profile - simplified as <strong>Jean's pro</strong>

## Description
<p>
This websites serves for Jean Damascene Twizeyimana's online profile to show case of both his professional and social values. It is also a single source of information on the about Jean's professional journey so far. 
</p>
<p>The website was designed and developed with user experience in mind.<br>
I have followed the five planes of UX as a guiding framework.<br> Departed from researching data about how to design and develop professional profiles websites and resume in general and in the online space; I have come up with the MUST-HAVE elements of my professional website and the BETTER_TO_HAVE aspects of my professional online profile<br>
I have design 3 different wireframes and by testing each with its fit to exemplify UX, they yielded into the current end-product here presented.</p>
<p>
  The end product here presented is made of the six sections or pages: the index.html, contact us section that is embedded in the index, about us section that is also embedded in the index, competences, projects, working with me, and the read me file. 
</p>

<p>
  Each Page of the website is divided into three main blocks: header, content seztion, and the footer section. <br>
  The header element is divided into two main sub-sections: a section for log and main menu; and a section for utility menus.
  the content section contains the content for the section or page concerned. And the footer section for privacy declaration, owner info., and bottom menus.

## External resources adapted
This website used own captured images and few free licensed images images from https://www.pexels.com/royalty-free-images/  
Also, in the contact us form we have adapted the code from the CI classrum.

## Development Cycle
This website was designed in the cloud by means of Cloud9 via Github and gitpod utilities.
With github the coding journey was documented and can be tracked now.

## Validation
The end product was validated and tested.
The html pages were validated by means of w3c html5 validator.
CSS code was validated by means of w3c jigsaw.
The product passed succeessfully both the w3c html and w3c css jigsaw validations.
It fullfils the optimal syntax requirements for html5 and css3. However, the syntax is not garanteed by these testing, it was rather 
addressed by following good logic of elements flow and the project goals.  

## Testing
The end product has undergone multiple testing as follows. Functional testing to test whether the products responds to the expected functions.
Usability testing to test the look and feel including colors against the expect colors to test the layout against the expected layout as of the wireframes.
The split testing to test variations of the look and feel, of positioning of elements, of colors, ...
I have conducted the compatibility test to test if the end product is compatible with mobile devices as it is for medium devices.
Also, I have tested the product in multiple browsers including internet explorer, mozilla firefox, and Google Chrome.
And lat but not least, I have tested the communicability of various modules which make the product (communication testing).
as a result, major communication errors were detected and resolved. Now the websites parts and pages communicate well as of the last testing.
The product was also tested on mobile devices and medium screens. So far, the product behaves well on mobile and on medium screen devices.
I did not test the product on very large devices.
THe rest testing concerns User and User Acceptance Testing (UAT). We hope to get feedback from users in regard to improvements for a better product.
